# Bash command used on pupil5 to perform Gibbs free energy calculations using MutateX.
# Accounts for both pdb 2K7W and the alphafold pdb structure for Q07812

# With the appropriate pdb file uploaded, the following command was executed along with its described options:
nohup mutatex [pdb file path] -p 4 -m mutation_list.txt -x /home/ctools/foldx5_2024/foldx -f suite5 -R repair_runfile_template.txt -M mutate_runfile_template.txt -L -l -v -C none &
#The files mutation_list.txt, repair_runfile_template.txt and mutate_runfile_template.txt were copied into the directory containing the pdb file, and changed to fit the needs for each run

# To see the calculations, the below commands were used frequently
htop
tail -f nohup.out

# After the calculations, the result files were aggregated using ddg2excel with the below command as template
/home/ctools/anaconda3_2021.11/bin/ddg2excel -p 2K7W.pdb -l mutation_list.txt -d results/mutation_ddgs/final_averages/ -F csv

# This creates the file "energies.csv" which can be downloaded locally using scp:
scp [login]@pupil5.healthtech.dtu.dk:/home/projects/22117_proteins/projects/group15/mutateX_[pdb]/energies.csv ./energies_[pdb].csv
